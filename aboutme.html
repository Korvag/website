                <p class="hero-text">
                    For the first few years of my life, I moved around a lot.  My family finally settled in North Carolina, where they have lived since 2006.  I was homeschooled K-12.  When I graduated highschool in 2018, I went to Franciscan University of Steubenville, where I graduated 4 years later with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Latin.  2 years later, in 2024, I started my Master's of Science in Criminal Justice, which I will graduate with in 2026.

                    In August of 2020, I started working for FUS as a student worker in the IT department.  In March of 2022, 2 months before graduating, I was hired by Dynamic Campus as a Technical Support Specialist working at FUS, where I stayed until October.  In October, I was promoted to the Applications Administrator for FUS, the role that I am still serving in.

                    I enjoy playing video games, coding, and shooting guns in my free time.
